# Snake Game

#### My attempt at making the classic snake game in Javascript. Play it [here!](http://gordwest.com/snake_game/index)

## Made with the help of
- Youtube channel [CodeWithKris](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWkzkhQ3syxBjjAYwqCbzYg)

## Intentions
- Create the game snake
- Gain enough JS skills to be able to making my own game from scratch. 

## Features
- Control snake with arrow keys
- Eat snacks and grow longer in length
- Keep track of score
- Handles snake collision (no collision with walls)

## Goals
- System to track highscores
